### PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Reserve by Ramky is an exclusive 19.2-acre villa retreat in Harshaguda, South Hyderabad, blending modern luxury with the serenity of countryside living. Strategically located near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport and upcoming infrastructure, it offers seamless city connectivity while ensuring tranquil escapes. Inspired by the Park Street concept, every villa is just steps away from one of 10 themed pocket parks, interconnected by lush green corridors and a central loop road for privacy and safety. Residents enjoy world-class amenities across dual clubhouses, featuring pools, sports courts, wellness spaces, and social hubs. Villas, ranging from 5,500 to 8,000 sq. ft., are Vaastu-compliant with private gardens, double-height dining areas, courtyards, and terraces. With contemporary architecture, premium finishes, and expansive open spaces, The Reserve by Ramky redefines luxury villa living in South Hyderabad.
