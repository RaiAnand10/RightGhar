Modern luxury is the ability to think clearly, sleep deeply,
move slowly, and live quietly in a world designed to prevent all four.

LANSUM Evana Chevella

ensures you get all four
in abundance!

Life Anew at

Lansum Evana, Chevella

Tucked away in the quiet charm of Chevella, Lansum Evana is a world designed for
those who seek balance between calm and convenience, nature and necessity. Spread across
34 acres of green landscapes, the project features 251 thoughtfully designed 3 BHK
villas with private basements, Evana is a way to live better.

Here, mornings begin with birdsong, not honking horns. Yet, every modern
comfort, from connectivity to essentials, is always within easy reach. It’s where open
skies meet open minds, where every square foot is built not just for function, but for
feeling.

\- peace, beauty and practicality in one home? We believe you can!

Highlights of the Evana Lifestyle

![...](https://lansumproperties.com/evana-chevella/assets/images/ThinkClearly.png)

##### Think Clearly

Clarity begins with space, both around you and
within. At Evana, nature does the decluttering. Surrounded by green
expanses, quiet corners and fresh air, your thoughts begin to
untangle, ideas find room to grow and focus comes without force.

![...](https://lansumproperties.com/evana-chevella/assets/images/SleepDeeply.png)

##### Sleep Deeply

In Evana, nights are hushed by trees, not traffic.
Bedrooms are bathed in calm, not clutter. With gentle winds, natural
ventilation and a peaceful setting, your body slows, your breath
softens and rest becomes an everyday ritual.

![...](https://lansumproperties.com/evana-chevella/assets/images/MoveSlowly.png)

##### Move Slowly

Here, no one’s racing the clock. Whether it’s a
morning stroll under green canopied paths, cycling past blooming
gardens, or stretching under the open sky, movement at Evana is
mindful; measured not in steps taken, but in joy found.

![...](https://lansumproperties.com/evana-chevella/assets/images/LiveQuietly.png)

##### Live Quietly

Evana isn’t about escaping life, it’s about
embracing a better one. One where conversations are longer, routines
are gentler and the soul feels seen. Nestled in Chevella, Evana
offers a new kind of luxury, one where peace and practicality
coexist effortlessly.

Every Detail,

An Invitation to Slow Down!

What does it take to design a life that feels unhurried? You begin by listening
to nature, to space, to silence.

At Evana, the outdoors aren’t just landscaped; they’re meant to be lived in.
The indoors aren’t just luxurious; they’re deeply thoughtful. Every element is a gentle
nudge to breathe, connect and live life a little more mindfully than yesterday.
