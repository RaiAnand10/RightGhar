## The musical hook in    Hyderabad’s skies

Myscape Songs of the Sun comprises of 4 towers of linear residences built in only two formats – the 2900 sq ft, 3 BHK apartments and the 3300 sq ft, 4 BHK apartments. With 4 units to a floor, each apartment resides in one corner of the tower, allowing for indoor outdoor integration and improved daylight penetration.

The site houses 592 residences among four towers that are Ground + 37 floors high. The landscape layout is abundant with open spaces and integrated with a progression of activities varying in pace and palete for your multigenerational family. The unique envelope articulation of the buildings, the prominent urban elevation, the juxtaposition of the towers, all give a visual character and a unique identity to the project and its surroundings.
