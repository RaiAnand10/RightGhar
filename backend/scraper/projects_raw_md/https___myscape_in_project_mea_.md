Myscape Mea is a boutique property, designed and developed, only, for the discerning few. The name Mea is closely associated with Me, My, Mine; terms that strongly connote individuality.

### As Unique   As The Owner

Unlike the high rise concept as we know it, Mea is protective of the privacy of its residents. Exclusivity is maintained with a one and two apartments per floor norm while the total number of apartments is even more surprising – a welcome 45 in number –with 38 apartments upto 4700 square feet area. The exquisite penthouses, all of 7 in number, sprawl lavishly across a delicious 8500 sq.ft. area.

The landscaping is aesthetically natural with wrap around balcony decks and planted parapets lending a dimension of ‘gardens-in-the sky’ to the ambient surroundings. And then there are glass window edifices that ensure that sufficient sunshine floods your living and dining areas.

Keeping in mind the popularity of Myscape Courtyard, Mea has been developed and designed to ensure every window opens out to lush 18 acres of Courtyard territory while some windows look onto urban downtown views.
