### ONE TOWER.   ONE APARTMENT PER FLOOR.

The property reeks of exclusivity. There’s only one tower for example. And only one apartment per floor. Add to that, only 28 of them for the taking. So that’s how exclusive and private it is. The ground floor is 16 feet high, with a grand entrance and is reserved for lifestyle amenities.

There’s the stunning 360 degree view from all four sides of the apartment. Plus, a grand lobby, an infinity pool and a gym on the terrace, so you have a birds eye view of the world, so to speak.

If you like greenery, you’ll love the protruded balconies that peek into the refreshing vertical garden that is home to 250 trees, some of them growing to 12 feet.

The apartment is spread across 4 spacious bedrooms, so it wouldn’t be a stretch to say you’d be owning a villa in the sky.
