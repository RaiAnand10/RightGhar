### Like Jenga,   only you'll live in it.

The Loft’s Jenga-like structure is also an ingenious architectural device that creates a multi-volume experience throughout. Double height slits filter in natural light to play with the landscape.

The alternating shifting floor plates create unique art with shadows and light across every unit. All this unfiltered nature and sun is bound to add a little tranquility.

Designed to form an iconic residential high-rise in the heart of the city, each floor has just two apartments – spanning a breathtaking 5000 sqft across 4 beautifully designed bedrooms.

The shifting light and shadow patterns with the movement of the sun above adds a constant drama with the elements outside.
