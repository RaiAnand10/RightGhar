# 4 BHK Luxury Flats and Apartments at Neopolis, Kokapet

## Where Every Moment Matters More

Grava Residences stands as an architectural masterpiece — seven magnificent towers that redefine the
essence of luxury living. Among them, one tower ascends to an awe-inspiring Ground + 54 floors, while the
remaining six rise gracefully with Ground + 49 floors each, together composing a skyline of unmatched
grandeur.

Nestled in the prestigious Neopolis, Kokapet, My Home Grava Residences offers much to take pride in.
Spanning 17.52 acres with 80% open space, the enclave is designed to let every breath feel freer, every
moment more expansive. Each tower is a vision of thoughtful design, crafted to meet the aspirations of
affluent, multi-generational families who value both elegance and comfort.

The expansive 4BHK residences embody abundance — featuring a private home theatre, cascading balconies, and
panoramic vistas that capture the beauty of life both within and beyond your home.

The name “Grava”, inspired by the majesty of the mountains, symbolizes grandeur and permanence — a tribute
to all that is timeless, powerful, and extraordinary.

## An Otherworldly Vibe — Live the Gregarious Life

Living at Grava Residences is your everyday vitamin to perform excellently in the world outside your
house. And an integral part of this vitamin is the 7 floor, 1,20,000 sq ft clubhouse and its amenities to
make your indulgences come alive and scream with joy. Relax, rejuvenate, and reimagine yourself.

Watch life be re-born, as you breathe, pause to reflect, think, and create. It is an environment
conducive to escapes and discoveries, in solitude or in cohabitation with your community.
