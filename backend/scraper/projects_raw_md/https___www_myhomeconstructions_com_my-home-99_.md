![My Home99 Main Entrance Gate](https://www.myhomeconstructions.com/my-home-99/assests/img/aminities/MAIN-ENTRANCE-GATE.webp)

## MAIN ENTRANCE GATE

The landscape is designed as a retreat for its residents, woven with experiences that restore the body, mind, and soul.
The grand entrance and drop-off zone sit at the dedicated vehicular level, opening into spaces crafted for calm,
connection, and everyday ease.

![My Home99 Entrance Lobby](https://www.myhomeconstructions.com/my-home-99/assests/img/aminities/ENTRANCE-LOBBY.webp)

## ENTRANCE LOBBY

The entrance lobby is a soaring space filled with dazzling
compositions of classics and contemporaries. Welcoming seating
areas are interspersed with ornate columns, accent art, and a
feature staircase for added dimension. The immersive doors and
windows let the views burst in. Now, that is what you call a
grand entrance.


![Living Room](https://www.myhomeconstructions.com/my-home-99/assests/img/aminities/SPACIOUS-LIVING-AND-DINING-AREAS.webp)

## LIVING ROOM

The My Home 99 residences are built to be lived in a long time by
generations of families. The sunburst living room preserves the
emphasis on the uninterrupted views, a mainstay in the vibe of the
house. You can gel with the vibe over an intimate evening, storytime
with the kids, or perhaps a sparkling Diwali party, decked
for the occasion. Extending out of the living room is an impressive
14ft sit-out to host an evening outdoor, inside your house.


![My Home99 Wrap A Round Balconies](https://www.myhomeconstructions.com/my-home-99/assests/img/aminities/WRAP-A-ROUND-BALCONIES.webp)

## WRAP A ROUND BALCONIES

The waterfront vistas are a permanent feature into your homes.
Taking a step closer into the vastness are decks extending out of
every room of the house. The balconies run continuously along
the exterior wall of the building and form a prominent feature of
its façade. The living room shows off its 14 ft deep decks while the
bedroom balconies feel sheepish under the 6ft depth.
You think you might get tired of the view, but every morning
as the sun rises, your jaw will start to drop. It is alright. We are
human, after all.


![My Home99 Master Bedroom](https://www.myhomeconstructions.com/my-home-99/assests/img/aminities/MASTER-BEDROOM.webp)

## MASTER BEDROOM

The master bedroom is tucked into the southwest corner of the
house in all the 99 units, complying with Vastu Shashtra, blessed
by the Gods. It is a large space with a lounge area to enjoy your
cup of tea before the kids rush in, knocking on your balcony
windows that wrap around continuously along the boundary of the
house. Each bedroom has a roomy walk-in closet so you can take
your time to dress up. Keep them waiting, alright.

## The Clubhouse

One starts to reassess the way they
want to live their life when they witness
the stupefying 4 level clubhouse at My
Home 99. It is a visual delight that spells
grandeur from base to top.
With its landscape pockets, cladded
columns, and the perforated jali and the
swimming pool are under an enjoyable
shade from the blazing sunlight.
